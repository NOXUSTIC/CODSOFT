TASK1.py Code Explanation:

1. Purpose:
This script is a machine learning pipeline for genre classification of movie descriptions. It loads, preprocesses, and analyzes movie data to predict genres based on plot descriptions.

2. Key Components:

2.1. Imports:
- pandas/numpy: Data manipulation
- sklearn: Machine learning tools
- matplotlib/seaborn: Visualization
- re: Text cleaning

2.2. Data Loading:
- The load_data() function reads a text file where each line contains movie details separated by ':::'.
- It handles both training data (with genre labels) and test data (without labels).
- Data is stored in a pandas DataFrame with columns: id, title, genre, description.

2.3. Text Preprocessing:
- clean_text() function converts text to lowercase and removes punctuation.
- Applied to the 'description' column to create 'clean_description'.

2.4. Data Splitting:
- The dataset is split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets.

2.5. Machine Learning Models:
Three classification models are implemented:
- Naive Bayes: Simple probabilistic classifier
- Logistic Regression: Linear classification model
- SVM (Support Vector Machine): Powerful classifier for high-dimensional data

Each model uses:
- TfidfVectorizer: Converts text to numerical features
- Classifier: The actual prediction algorithm

2.6. Model Evaluation:
For each model, the script:
- Trains on the training data
- Predicts genres for validation data
- Prints a classification report (precision, recall, f1-score)
- Displays a confusion matrix visualization

3. Workflow:
1. Load and preprocess training data
2. Split into training/validation sets
3. Train three different models
4. Evaluate each model's performance
5. Visualize results with confusion matrices

4. Key Observations:
- The script expects data in a specific format (::: separated)
- Currently uses only the description text for classification
- Includes comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Provides visual feedback through confusion matrices

5. Potential Improvements:
- Add feature engineering (e.g., title analysis)
- Implement hyperparameter tuning
- Add cross-validation
- Include more advanced text processing (lemmatization, stopwords)
- Handle warnings about undefined metrics by:
  * Setting zero_division parameter in classification_report()
  * Ensuring all genre classes have sufficient training samples
  * Using class balancing techniques if data is imbalanced
  * Considering stratified sampling during train-test split

6. Runtime Warnings:
The script generates warnings about undefined precision metrics when:
- Some genre classes have no predicted samples
- This typically occurs with imbalanced datasets or when the model fails to predict certain classes
- Solutions include:
  * Setting zero_division=0 in classification_report()
  * Using class_weight='balanced' in classifiers
  * Applying oversampling/undersampling techniques
